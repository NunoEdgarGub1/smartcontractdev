# Smart Contract Rapid Development (examples)
This repository holds examples and walkthroughs of smart contract development with modern frameworks and tooling to increase developer productivity.  There are 2 primary examples, one with an Ethereum network based on proof of authority and another based on Quorum (Permissioned Ethereum network).  Both of these run the blockchain network in a single Azure VM.

## Example 1 - Smart Contracts from Scratch with VSCode, Truffle and Ethereum
This example will show how to use modern development tools to build, test, debug and deploy a smart contract locally (emulation for rapid development) and then deployment / testing to Azure based infrastruce using Ethereum.

### **SETUP**
Run the [following steps](/example1-setup.md) to setup the tools for development

### **WALKTHROUGH**
Navigate [here](/walkthrough1.md) and follow the steps to use the tooling to build a new smart contract.

## Example 2 - Smart Contracts using transaction level privacy with VSCode, Truffle and Quorum

### **SETUP**
Run the [following steps](/example2-setup.md) to setup the tools for development

### **WALKTHROUGH**
Navigate [here](/walkthrough2.md) and follow the steps to use the tooling to build a new smart contract.
